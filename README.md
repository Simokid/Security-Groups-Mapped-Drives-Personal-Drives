<h1>Overview: Lab 7 Security Groups, Mapped Drives, Personal Drives</h1>

This section of my home lab documentation focuses on managing **Security Groups**, **Mapped Drives**, and **Personal Drives** in a domain environment. The project demonstrates how to create and configure security groups for managing permissions, set up mapped drives for network access, and configure personal drives for user-specific storage. 

<h2>Objectives</h2>

- Create and configure **Security Groups** in Active Directory to manage access to resources and network drives.
- Set up **Mapped Drives** to enable users to access shared resources across the network automatically.
- Configure **Personal Drives** for individual users to store data securely in the domain environment.
- Implement best practices for **permission management** using security groups and ensuring appropriate access control for mapped and personal drives.


<h2>Documentation</h2>

In this home lab, we will focus on implementing **Security Groups**, **Mapped Drives**, **Personal Drives**, and **Drive Letter Mapping**. Letâ€™s start by opening **Server Manager** on our **Windows Server 2022**. Then, select **File and Storage Services** on the left-hand side, followed by **Shares**. Right-click and select **New Share**.
